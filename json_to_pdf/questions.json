        "question": "Explain the ground tissue system and its components in different parts of a plant.",
        "answer": "The ground tissue system encompasses all tissues of a plant except for the epidermis and the vascular bundles. It is composed of simple tissues: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma. The distribution and function of these tissues vary in different parts of the plant. In the primary stems and roots, parenchymatous cells are found in the cortex, pericycle, pith, and medullary rays, where they are involved in storage, photosynthesis, and secretion. In leaves, the ground tissue is specialized into mesophyll, which consists of thin-walled, chloroplast-containing cells and is the primary site of photosynthesis. The ground tissue system, therefore, plays a vital role in various metabolic and structural functions of the plant.",
